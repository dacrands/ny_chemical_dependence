# NY Chemical Dependence Admissions 2007-2015
Visualizes chemical dependence in NY state from 2007-2015.

## Background
Perhaps reflecting my experience in clinical-psychology research, I felt motivated to visualize some mental-health data. 
This was the first psychology related Excel file I found via data.gov, and I think the data tells a particularly interesting story.

### Data
You may find the data for this program [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/chemical-dependence-treatment-program-admissions-beginning-2007). I think open-source data, or more specifically **data transparency** (i.e., the willingness to share data with other scientists
to replicate one's results), is incredibly important. I understand acquiring data can be expensive, but it shouldn't be *that* expensive in modern times. Paywall the papers, open-source the data I say! 

## Results and Armchair Theorizing
This can be dangerous and lead to erroneous assumptions by others, so I'll refrain from drawing any scientific conclusions from this data (for now...). The point of this project was to visualize mental-health data using Python, which in and of itself, through the purity of coordinate geometry, can be an effective tool for drawing conclusions about the world.
