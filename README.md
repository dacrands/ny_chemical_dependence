# NY Chemical Dependence Admissions 2007-2015
Visualizes chemical dependence in NY state from 2007-2015.

## Background
Perhaps reflecting my experience in clinical-psychology research, I felt motivated to visualize some mental-health data. 
This was the first psychology related Excel file I found via data.gov, and I think the data tells a particularly interesting story.

### Data
You may find the data for this program [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/chemical-dependence-treatment-program-admissions-beginning-2007). I think open-source data, or more specifically **data transparency** (i.e., the willingness to share data with other scientists
so they may replicate a study's results), is incredibly important. I understand acquiring data can be expensive, but it shouldn't be *that* expensive in modern times. Paywall the papers, open-source the data I say! 

## Results
### Danger of Arm Chair Theorizing
This can be dangerous and lead to erroneous assumptions by others, so I'll refrain from drawing any scientific conclusions from this data (for now...). The point of this project was to visualize mental-health data using Python, which in and of itself, through the purity of coordinate geometry, can be an effective tool for drawing conclusions about the world.

### Ikea Chair Theorizing
Though the samples for every chemical save heroin, which has a relatively normal distribution, is skewed to one direction or the other, the bell is there. This is for every chemical except marijuana/hasish. 

As the graph indicates, marijuana admissions across programs have a consistent inverse-relationship with age, i.e., as age increases, marijuana admissions dercrease. As to why this is so, I would argue that parents, having seen individuals who have lived with untreated marijuana addictions, are more aware of its consequences than younger individuals, and thus understand the necessity of treatment -- this is why we see most individuals being treated for marijuana dependence are less than eighteen years old. As individuals age, however, parental influence decreases and the perception of marijuana as an addictive drug is lessened among peers via stereotypes related to drug addictions, e.g. "Weed isn't addicitive."
