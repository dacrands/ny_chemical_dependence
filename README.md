# NY Chemical Dependence Admissions 2007-2015
Visualizes chemical dependence in NY state from 2007-2015.

## Background

Perhaps reflecting my experience in clinical-psychology research, I felt motivated to visualize mental-health data. 
This was the first familiar psychology related Excel file I found via data.gov and I think the data tells a particularly interesting story.

### Data

You may find the data for this program [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/chemical-dependence-treatment-program-admissions-beginning-2007). I think open-source data, or more specifically **data transparency** (i.e., the willingness to share data with other scientists
to replicate one's results), is incredibly important. I understand acquiring data can be expensive, but it shouldn't be that *that* expensive. Paywall the papers, open-source the data I say (at least for academic articles making claims regarding the general population). 

## Results and Armchair Theorizing

This can be dangerous and lead to erroneous assumptions by others, so I'll refrain from drawing any scientific conclusions from this data (for now...). The point of this project was to visualize mental-health, which in and of itself, through the purity of coordinate geometry, can be an effective in
drawing conclusions about the world.
